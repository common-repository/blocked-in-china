== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the Blocked in China API work? =

The Blocked in China API uses multiple servers to check your site's status from within China, depending on the current server usage at the time. The primary API we're currently using comes from viewdns.info. 

= Where are the servers located? =

Servers are currently available in 5 regions, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang Province, and Yunnan Province.

= Why do I need to check my site’s availability in China? =

Internet usage is restricted in China. Many websites are not able to be accessed due to government limitations. 

= How can I guarantee my site is available in China? = 

While there is no way to guarantee your site will always be available in China, you can register with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology for an ICP license. This requires that your website is hosted in China. While it is not required to have an ICP license to ensure your site can be visited from China, it can help assure that your site will be available because all requirements are met for your website. 

= Does my website have to be hosted in China to be available in China? =

No. Your website can be hosted anywhere in the world. As long as the server or URL has not been blocked by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, then your site will be available in the mainland.
